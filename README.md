# Customer-Behavior-Prediction-for-Cell-Phone-Company
Business Analytics Course Project

###Business Scenario:
• There are 1,000,000 customers, of which 490,000 are likely to stay another year and 510,000 are likely to leave. The carrier does not know which customer is likely to stay or leave.

• A customer that stays will provide a NPV of $1,000 to the carrier. The NPV from a customer who leaves is $0.

• The firm has three strategies:

- a. Do nothing. Let the customers who are likely to leave, do so.

- b. Offer every customer a discount of $400 on a new phone. A customer who was going to stay will continue to stay and enjoy the discount. A customer who was likely to leave will now stay with a 0.50 probability. The discount is wasted on customers who end up leaving any way.

- c. Construct a prediction model to predict whether a customer will leave or stay. Use the prediction model to offer the discount only to the customers who are predicted to leave. The behavior of the customers who are predicted to leave and receive a discount remains as described above.

• Consider LEAVE to be the Negative Class and STAY to be the Positive class. Denote the FPR by α and FNR by β. Find the expected value of each of the three strategies. Write the expected value of strategy (c) in the form of:
      v – a . α – b . β
where a is the False Positive Cost and b is the False Negative Cost
